Student Housing NYC.

## Keywords
Simpleness, intuitive, useful.

## Brief Description
My goal for this project is to make a functional website that fulfills the requirements of the task, and to also make it good looking so it feels like a real website, i want to keep the site simple without neglecting the functional part of it, which i consider is more important than the appearence.

## Dataset use
* [NY Districts geoshapes] [ https://services5.arcgis.com/GfwWNkhOj9bNBqoJ/arcgis/rest/services/nycd/FeatureServer/0/query?where=1=1&outFields=*&outSR=4326&f=geojson] I used GeoJSON to draw very easily the different districts in NY, and assigned a different color to each district so it's easy to diferentiate them.
*  [New York City housing by building data] [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/hg8x-zxpr/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD] I used this dataset to place markers in a map according to housing information in NY, i plan to make queries over this dataset to show the markers according to the district that the user selects.

## Aditional information
I consider according to what ive learned so far that this will be a very enriching experience, because i didnt had previous knowledge in the languages that were using, so i hope i take advantage of this competition to learn a lot.
